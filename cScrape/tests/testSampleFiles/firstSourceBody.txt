		Make $$ NOW in Fun, Busy Office w/Lots of room to GROW! <br>
I am a real estate rental agent at a growing real estate firm located in a Loft space on the Upper West Side.<br>
<br>
I am looking to hire friendly, smart, and ambitious people to join my team.<br>
<br>
You will take pictures of apartments, place ads, meet cool people, show apartments, and earn while you learn.<br>
<br>
We have a lot of actors and musicians and other folks working at our agency so your schedule is flexible but  the more you work, the more money you will make. You will have your own desk, phone, and computer. Now is the perfect time to jump in.<br>
<br>
I will train you to generate business off the phone on your first day and give you continuous hands on attention.<br>
